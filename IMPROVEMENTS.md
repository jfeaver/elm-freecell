- 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
- CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves and auto moves)
- Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
- Undo
- Seeded games (maybe an easy win game to make dev easier)
- Win/Loss conditions and messages
- hitbox drop collisions (versus point collision right now)
- ignore right click
- highlight any possible card location other than free cells
- pulse possible card locations twice and then stop
- The card highlight feels like it sinks the card rather than drawing it forward
- The card highlight is a suggestion so it shouldn't highlight a card directly above the focused card
- Add focused pile indicator showing the maximum movable pile
- When I'm tired, it's hard to see the transition point between a highlighted card and a pile indicator
