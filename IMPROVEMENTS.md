- Undo doesn't animate cards
- Does it work on mobile?
- The way the autosolver is toggled off during undo is a surprising experience
- highlight foundation where a hovered card could go
- Win condition and messages
- foundation highlights could be blue
- swap location of cells and foundations
- menu for all my actions
- instructions (controls and link to game rules)
- prefer auto moves to cascades that are piles from the very top
- add a redo
- change drag and drop pointer to a gripped hand?
- Toss in Html.lazy ftw (follow the guide)
- minify JS in build ftw (follow the guide)
- animate failed drag and drop move returning to its origin
- 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
- CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves, auto moves, autosolved moves)
- Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
- ignore right click
- convert pile into an opaque type
- multi-game history
- loss condition and message?
