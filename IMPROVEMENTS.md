- highlight next foundation card on hover over foundation
- Win/Loss conditions and messages
- hitbox drop collisions (versus point collision right now)
- 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
- CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves and auto moves)
- Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
- ignore right click
- highlight any possible card location other than free cells
- pulse possible card locations twice and then stop (??)
