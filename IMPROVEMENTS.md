- Does it work on mobile?
- Toggling off the autosolver is a surprising experience
- highlight foundation where a hovered card could go
- Win/Loss conditions and messages
- hitbox drop collisions (versus point collision right now)
- foundation highlights could be blue
- swap location of cells and foundations
- menu for all my actions
- instructions (controls and link to game rules)
- prefer auto moves to cascades that are piles from the very top
- add a redo
- 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
- CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves, auto moves, autosolved moves)
- Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
- ignore right click
- convert pile into an opaque type
- multi-game history
