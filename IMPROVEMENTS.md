* Card positions could be based on their pile position rather than individually positioned
* 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
* CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves)
* Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
* mouse pointer style on hover

* Can move a large pile off of a cascade as if we were using its own cascade as an empty one
* The bottom of the table doesnâ€™t stretch for long cascades
