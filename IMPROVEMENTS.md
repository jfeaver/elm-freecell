FIXME: focused card no longer transfers to the card behind (no pointer cursor) (sometimes?)
FIXME: drag and drop is broken? Sometimes but not others?

- Seeded games (maybe an easy win game to make dev easier)

- 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
- CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves and auto moves)
- Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
- Win/Loss conditions and messages
- hitbox drop collisions (versus point collision right now)
- ignore right click
- highlight any possible card location other than free cells
- pulse possible card locations twice and then stop (??)
- When I'm tired, it's hard to see the transition point between a highlighted card and a pile indicator
