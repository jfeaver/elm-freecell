- Does it work on mobile?
- The way the autosolver is toggled off during undo is a surprising experience
- highlight foundation where a hovered card could go
- Win condition and messages
- foundation highlights could be blue
- swap location of cells and foundations
- menu for all my actions
- instructions (controls and link to game rules)
- prefer auto moves to cascades that are piles from the very top
