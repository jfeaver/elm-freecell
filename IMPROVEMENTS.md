- Card positions could be based on their pile position rather than individually positioned
- 50 images are loaded separately!! Let's embed the SVG directly?
- CSS animations/animation frames (animate cancelled moves)
- Error messages (Can't do that because ...)
- mouse pointer style on hover
- double click card moves
